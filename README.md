# Stand-Up Bingo

Finally, Stand-Ups can be good for something.

A mildly janky game of Stand-Up Bingo. Download it and upload it quietly to your own work servers to share with your colleagues.

You can change the background images and options inside of the accompanying Json file.

This repo is a bit janky, but so are Stand-Ups. It's fine.
